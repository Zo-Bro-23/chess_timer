                <h3 id= "s1">What is ZSAT chess timer beta?</h3>
                    <p>ZSAT chess timer is an app that helps you play chess with another person! Simple as that! It's a <em>dynamic</em>
                    software. Basically, it's a mobile app that acts like a timer, but it's more than that. You can set a match timer
                    limit and both the players have a total move time limit within that limit. Player one starts. After he moves, he presses
                    the button. His timer pauses and player two's timer starts. When player two pauses, his timer resumes from where
                    he stopped off at his last move. Pretty neat, huh? This is the idea behind the app. You will also be able to save
                    matches with the match name, and each time you open the app, it asks you whether you want to start off from a
                    previously saved match. &#129320 The app is still under developing. &#128530 <strong>BUT</strong>, you can
                    still use the app. &#128527 This is where the "beta" comes in... In the beta version, we are not assuring 
                    you a bug-less glitch-less app. But you can still use the app with minimalistic features. In this particular
                    beta version, you can only use the timer on-board. That is, if you close the app and open it again, it will be
                    just like when you first used it. So basically, the app won't store anything, yet. Soon, in the next beta 
                    release, I will be adding the save match feature. Yay!
                    </p>
                <h3 id= "s2">Why do I care?</h3>
                    <p>I don't know, how am I supposed to know? Maybe because this is the best chess timer out there to prove your
                        chess skills to your opponent? Anyhow, you'll be able to use this wonderful chess app to play chess with
                        your family, friends and foe while at the same time you'll be able to help us by sending us crash reports, 
                        comments, feedback, improvements and much more. And seriously, you don't expect me to answer the question
                        "What's in it for me?" when both of us know how much you'll benefit from the beta version of this app.
                    </p>
                <h3 id= "s3">Why can't I just go to Google Play Store and download it?</h3>
                    <p>Well, you can, just by clicking <a href= "">here</a>, but I would discourage it. I recommend installing using
                        <a href= "#s4">this method</a> and here's a number of reasons why:
                    </p>
                        <h4>Google Play Store takes a <strong style="color: black;">looong</strong> time to review apps</h4>
                            <p>
                                I order to publish an app on Google Play Store, you need to wait soo long. They will take 8-9 days
                                to review your app no matter how small it is. They will re-check if you are following their privacy
                                policy, they will check if you have violence, they will check whether the app is meant for children, 
                                they just have an endless checklist. Your Google Developer account homepage will look like this 
                                whenever they are reviewing your app which is <strong>always</strong>.
                                <img src= "./Screenshot (159).png" style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; height: auto;"
                            </p>
                            <p> What is the problem with that you may ask. The problem is, you will mostly miss out on new beta 
                                releases and you may even always be stuck with a beta version that has a lot of bugs. When the 
                                app releases for production, I would anyways recommend you to use the Google Play Store version
                                as it will have been tested.
                            </p>
                            
                        <h4>They reject your app even if there is only a small bug</h4>
                            <p>
                                I guess the heading says it all. So again, same problem. You'll miss out on new releases and will
                                have to use old versions which have as many bugs as my garbage bin.
                            </p>
                <h3 id= "s4">Ok, where do I start?</h3>
                            <p>
                                This is the shortest paragraph ever. You start installing the latest version by opening this website on your android device and 
                                clicking <a href= "./ZSAT_chess_timer-1.1.3_beta.apk">here</a>. And, you're done. If you want to install older versions, for some 
                                reason, you may click <a href= "./versions.html">here</a> to view older versions.
                            </p>
                <h3 id= "s5">Oh, it's that easy?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Well, yup! It is, that easy. If you don't believe me, check for yourself. This <strong>IS</strong>
                                it. You're officially done installing ZSAT chess timer.
                            </p>
                <h3 id= "s6">An extra, step? Thought so!</h3>
                <p>
                    Well, almost. Just another step. After you download the beta application package (APK), you have to open it. 
                    (You may be prompted <em>This type of file may harm your device. Do you want to continue?</em>, do not get 
                    freaked out, it's fine, I'm <strong>NOT</strong> a bad mad hacker) After you open it, you will recieve a prompt 
                    from your device that may say something like <em>For your safety, Google Chrome is not allowed to install 
                    applications from unknown sources. Go to settings to change that.</em> according to your android version. 
                    Click on whatever button that appears along with the prompt that says something like <em>Settings</em>. 
                    Turn the radio button on for your web browser. Hit the back button. Click install. The latest version of <strong> 
                    ZSAT Chess timer</strong> is now installed on your device. Can you believe it? It's installed! You gotta thank me!

                    <p>
                        Yup! Don't mind me if I take a bit of the praise too. I showed you how to do this after all! And the beta 
                        release is something that's one of a kind. Now you can play chess with your <em>people</em> with your 
                        favourite timer. And let's face it, this is the best timer in a long while. And learn to appriciate 
                        things when you have them. I'm planning to include ads. I'll think about it.
                    </p>
                <h3 id= "s8">The app is pretty good after all!</h3>
                    <p>
                        See, told you! The app has some pretty cool feautures like naming matches and way more cooler feautures 
                        are coming up like saving matches. It is always good to stay up-to-date on beta releases as there might 
                        be some bugs in the older versions. Feel free to leave any comments, feedback, improvements, suggestions, 
                        bugs, appriciations and much more <a href= "./comment.html">here</a>.
