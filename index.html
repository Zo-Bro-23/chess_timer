                    <p>ZSAT chess timer is an app that helps you play chess with another person! Simple as that! It's a <em>dynamic</em>
                    software. Basically, it's a mobile app that acts like a timer, but it's more than that. You can set a match timer
                    limit and both the players have a total move time limit within that limit. Player one starts. After he moves, he presses
                    the button. His timer pauses and player two's timer starts. When player two pauses, his timer resumes from where
                    he stopped off at his last move. Pretty neat, huh? This is the idea behind the app. You will also be able to save
                    matches with the match name, and each time you open the app, it asks you whether you want to start of from a
                    previously saved match. &#129320 The app is still under devoloping. &#128530 <strong>BUT</strong>, you can
                    still use the app. &#128527 This is where the "beta" comes in... In the beta version, we are not assuring 
                    you a bug-less glitch-less app. But you can still use th app with minimalistic features. In this particular
                    beta version, you can only use the timer on-board. That is, if you close the app and open it again, it will be
                    just like when you first used it. So basically, the app won't store anything, yet. Soon, in the next beta 
                    release, I will be adding the save match feature. Yay!</p>
