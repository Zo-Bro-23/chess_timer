                    <p>ZSAT chess timer is an app that helps you play chess with another person! Simple as that! It's a <em>dynamic</em>
                    software. Basically, it's a mobile app that acts like a timer, but it's more than that. You can set a match timer
                    limit and both the players have a total moving time of that limit. Player one starts. After he moves, he presses
                    the button. His timer pauses and player two's timer starts. When player two pauses, his timer resumes from where
                    he stopped off at his last move. Pretty neat, huh? This is the idea behind the app. You will also be able to save
                    matches with the match name, and each time you open the app, it asks you whether you want to start of from a
                    previously saved match. The app is still under devoloping. :sad:</p>
